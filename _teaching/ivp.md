I served as a Teaching Assistant for the *Image and Video Processing*, under the guidance of <a href="https://people.iith.ac.in/sumohana/" target="_blank">Dr. Sumohana S. Channappayya</a>. In addition to the standard TA responsibilities of grading assignments and exams, I provided one-on-one support to students, helping them better understand complex concepts such as image compression, filtering, and image transformations. I actively engaged with students during the project phase, offering guidance on project ideas, implementation, and troubleshooting. This role also allowed me to better understand image and video processing techniques through regular interactions and discussions with students and faculty.

I served as a Teaching Assistant for the *Deep Learning*, under the guidance of <a href="https://krmopuri.github.io/" target="_blank">Dr. Konda Reddy Mopuri</a>. My role involved providing support throughout their individual projects, offering insights into model development, optimization techniques, and troubleshooting. Through active mentoring, I ensured students gained a deeper understanding of neural networks, backpropagation, and advanced techniques like GANs and transformers, fostering their ability to approach challenges with confidence and innovation.

Hello there! I'm Vikhyath. I recently graduated from <a href="https://www.iith.ac.in/" target="_blank">IIT Hyderabad</a> with a BTech in Computer Science and Engineering. Currently, I am working as an Associate Member of Technical Staff (AMTS) at <a href="https://www.salesforce.com/in/" target="_blank">Salesforce</a>, where I am part of the Contract Lifecycle Management (CLM) team.

## Research Interests:
My research and academic interests lie in the domain of Computer Vision, Machine Learning, and Data-driven Astronomy. I'm particularly interested in research areas such as Multimodal Learning, Transformer-based architectures, Explainability in Machine Learning, and Transfer learning. I aim to address challenges like handling out-of-distribution data and improving model robustness in applications such as astronomical image classification, autonomous systems, and AI interpretability.

## Personal Interests:
During my free time, youâ€™ll often find me playing badminton, football, jogging, or strategizing over various board games such as Catan. When I'm not on the move, I'm either binge-watching TV shows, stargazing, or getting lost in music. I also love to travel, exploring new places around the world whenever I can. Each journey allows me to experience different cultures and meet people from various backgrounds.

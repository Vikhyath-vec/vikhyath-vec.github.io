Hello there! I'm Vikhyath. I recently graduated from [IIT Hyderabad](https://www.iith.ac.in/) with a BTech in Computer Science and Engineering and am planning to pursue my master's starting in Fall 2025. Currently, I am working as an Associate Member of Technical Staff (AMTS) at [Salesforce](https://www.salesforce.com/in/), where I am part of the Contract Lifecycle Management (CLM) team.

My research and academic interests lie in the domain of Computer Vision, Machine Learning, and Data-driven Astronomy. I'm particularly interested in research areas such as Multimodal Learning, Transformer-based architectures, Explainability in Machine Learning, and Transfer learning. I aim to address challenges like handling out-of-distribution data and improving model robustness in applications such as astronomical image classification, autonomous systems, and AI interpretability.

During my free time, you’ll often find me playing badminton, football, jogging, or strategizing over various board games such as Catan. When I'm not on the move, I'm either binge-watching TV shows, stargazing, or getting lost in music. I also love to travel, exploring new places around the world whenever I can. Each journey allows me to experience different cultures and meet people from various backgrounds.

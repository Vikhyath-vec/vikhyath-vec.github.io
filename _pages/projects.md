### Exploring Neural Network Robustness through Benford's Law
*Data Science Analysis*

* Investigated the relationship between Neural Network parameter distributions and generalization using Benford’s Law (BL) as a naturalness measure.
* Introduced the Model Enthalpy (MLH) metric to assess closeness to BL, showing its strong correlation with Validation Accuracy and robustness properties.
* Demonstrated MLH’s potential as an alternative to Validation Accuracy for Early Stopping, achieving better test accuracy without needing a validation set.

## Research Projects

### Multimodal Learning for Astronomical Classification

* Designed multimodal algorithms based on CLIP and Swin Transformer architectures to classify faint & compact galaxies, stars, and quasars.
* Integrated five-channel image data with photometric features to enhance feature representation and improve classification robustness.
